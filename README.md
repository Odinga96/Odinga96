### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am **_David Odinga_**. I am really enthusiastic when it comes t API's . I currently invest my time in learning more about micro systems and their implementation using spring boot. I happen to also really love good looking UI's . Angular has come in handy as my front end frame work. Open to learning any good front end frame work though

Developer communities have been at my heart since day one of being a developer. So hope to meet you in one.
